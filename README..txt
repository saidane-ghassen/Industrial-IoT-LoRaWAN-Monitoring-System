Summer Internship – Industrial IoT Monitoring System (LoRaWAN + MQTT)

During my 2025 summer internship at YUCCAINFO (Sousse, Tunisia), I designed and prototyped a complete Industrial IoT monitoring node based on LoRaWAN and MQTT, as part of my Embedded Systems engineering program at ENISo.

The goal of the project was to build a long‑range, low‑power wireless sensor node capable of:
• Reading multiple sensors (vibration, current, temperature)
• Sending data over LoRaWAN (EU868) to a gateway
• Forwarding the data to the cloud via MQTT for visualization and analysis

On the technical side, the work covered:
• Study and implementation of LoRa / LoRaWAN (device classes, security with OTAA, network architecture)
• Study of the MQTT protocol and its integration in an IIoT context
• Selection and justification of all components (RAK3172 / STM32WLE5, sensors, power stage) with a compliance matrix
• Design of a custom 2‑layer PCB in Altium (schematic, layout, DRC, 2D/3D views)
• Prototype bring‑up, testing and validation on a real LoRaWAN network

Outcomes:
• Working hardware prototype with custom PCB
• Stable LoRaWAN communication and sensor data acquisition
• Complete documentation: report, research notes, BOM, schematics and test results

Full project (documentation, hardware and firmware) is available on GitHub:

I also attach a short overview of the project:

Many thanks to the YUCCAINFO team and to my academic supervisor for their guidance throughout this internship.
